### Naming
* Definitions are written in camlCase with the first letter non-capitalized
* Types are written in CamlCase with the first letter capitalized
* Theorems and Lemmas are written in underscore_non-capitalized_style
* Namespaces are aligned with mathlib when possible and like types elsewhere
* Sections are written non-capitalized without separation (but should now have multiple words)
